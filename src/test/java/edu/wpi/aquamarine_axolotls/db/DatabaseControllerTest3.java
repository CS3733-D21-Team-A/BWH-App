public class DatabaseControllerTest3 {
    // Tests for iteration 1

    // Try to write tests for every functionally unique case of a method.
    // Test for alternate versions of the same case to make sure your tests don't pass as flukes.
    // Each method must have an absolute minimum of two tests, should have more.
    // If you're unsure if a method is sufficiently tested, run the tests with code coverage to see if you're missing any cases.

    // Reminders:
    //  - You can use assertThrows to test expected errors.
    //  - If you're testing a state change, ensure the state before AND after the state change.
    //  - Be careful using @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @AfterALl, or @BeforeAll. These annotations will affect everyone's tests. If you need them, communicate with the team or make a new test file.
